            If the delete fails we want to return to this page with all fields populated as they are now.
            To achieve this our delete request needs to include the current form contents as a model attribute.
            This means we need to include the authorRequest object on the delete form, and the form needs to contain
            all the relevant input fields. We can place the input fields inside a hidden div.
